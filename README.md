# Project1

This is a project in which 3 separate minds combined as one! What we came up with correlates to issues/problems
seen everywhere today! Sometimes it's impossible to get a conversation going, to introduce some cool new facts in a 
conversation, or even find a way to escape such cruel and unusual punishment of needing to talk when you just don't feel like it. 
Also, Pokemon!
Our Chatter Portal will help you stay in or enter a conversation with ease, or escape with the strength of a raging river!

For this first project we decided to create a generator for Excuses, Trivia, Fun Facts, and Pokemon!
This works but pressing the generate buttons and it will pop up with something random for each category.
When you find one that you like, you are able to click the favorite button within that card and it will be saved to your local storage.
After you have found a few that you like, you can go ahead and press the favorites button at the bottom and it will pop up with a modal
and it will display your favorites within the local storage within the modal.
